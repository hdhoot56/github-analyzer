- Never expose sensitive credentials in client-side code
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Regularly rotate any API keys or tokens

### For Developers
- Follow secure coding practices
- Keep dependencies updated
- Use security linters and scanners
- Implement proper input validation
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement proper CORS policies
- Use HTTPS for all communications

- Keep security dependencies up to date

## Known Security Considerations

- The application requires a GitHub token with appropriate scopes
- Rate limiting is implemented to prevent abuse of the GitHub API
- Sensitive information is never stored in version control
- All API keys are passed via environment variables

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as patch versions. It is recommended to always use the latest version of the software.
